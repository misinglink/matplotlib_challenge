Analysis:

1) Capomulin and Ramicaine were the only drugs who had a negative impact  
    on tumor size.

2) Capomulin was more efficient then Ramicaine at keeping the mice
    alive than Ramicaine.

3) On average, tumors treated wth Ramicaine decreased in size more, 
    and had less metastatic sites.  

4) Surprisingly, the placebo doesn't have the lowest survival rates,
    there are some drugs who's performance loks sub-placebo performance,
    does this mean they are actaully aiding the development of Cancer?
    Could these drugs help us understand thedevelopment of Cancer through
    closer analysis. Ketapril increseas the size the most and has the most
    amount of metastatic sites from all the drugs.
